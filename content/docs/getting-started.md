# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/wokelang
cd wokelang

# Build the interpreter
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

## Your First Program

Create a file `hello.woke`:

```woke
to main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```

Run it:

```bash
wokelang hello.woke
```

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

```woke
remember x = 42;
remember name = "Alice";
remember isActive = true;
```

### Functions

```woke
to add(a: Int, b: Int) gives back Int {
    give back a + b;
}

remember result = add(5, 3);
print(result);  // 8
```

### Pattern Matching

```woke
type Option = Some(Int) | None;

to getValue(opt: Option) gives back Int {
    case opt of
        | Some(x) then x
        | None then 0
    end
}
```
